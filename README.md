# Dashboard

Dashboard is a short project built to practice CSS Grid and Flexbox. The page has no real content but dummy text, once the focus was to build up a nice interface using the feature.

## Contributing

This is not a project I'm looking contribution for â€” it's just a personal coding practice.

## Goals

If I ever revisit this project, I may:

1. Change the images to individual profile pictures;
2. Do a better alignment of the icons;
3. Rethink the colour scheme;
4. Make it responsive for smaller screens;
5. Redesign the search bar.

## Status

As for now, I consider I reached my initial goal of practicing CSS Grid. Therefore, the project is finished.
